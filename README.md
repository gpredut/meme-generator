# meme-generator
DOM-Manipulation project

- a user should be able to click buttons on the right side of the screen to generate a random meme, joke, quote, or riddle;

- only one piece of content should show at a time. For example, if the user clicks "Show a meme" and there is a quote showing already, 
the application should remove the quote and show a random meme;

-content should be displayed under the appropriate heading (i.e. a joke should not show up under the memes heading);

-when showing a random riddle, the answer should never be revealed without the user explicitly clicking the "Reveal Riddle Answer" button on the right;

-if a user clicks "Reveal Riddle Answer" and there is no riddle, an alert should let them know they need to generate a riddle first;

-if a user clicks "Reveal Riddle Answer" and the answer is already revealed, an alert should let them know that the answer is already revealed.
